Extensions to the Ruby Matrix module
====================================

This README is a small description of the work done by Cosmin Bonchis as a 
Google Summer of Code 2007 project for Ruby Central Inc.

The project consists of some enhancements to the Ruby "Matrix" module and includes: LU and QR (Householder, Givens, Gram Schmidt, Hessenberg) decompositions, bidiagonalization, eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations.            

This archive contains in extendmatrix.rb file the source code of the project, an implementation of mapcar used in extending matrix, and all the tests files in the "tests" directory.  

The code can also be found on the RubyForge repository at http://matrix.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/ or the project's SVN repository can be checked out through anonymous access with the following command(s).

svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/matrix
svn checkout http://matrix.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/
